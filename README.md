# JSONBaker

JSONBaker is a quick yet efficient tool I developed in just few minutes to solve a recurring problem I face while analyzing cookies from Chrome during web automation tasks. This tool is designed to simplify the process of converting cookie data from cURL commands and plain cookie strings into a readable JSON format.
